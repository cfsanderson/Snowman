# Snowman App

It's like hangman, but in reverse!

This app was a lot of fun. It was completed as part of my course work at The Iron Yard during the 2016 holiday season. It was one of our first attempts at a React app. The assignment was to practice writing the Javascript game logic, build out the React components, and personalize it. The snowman animation and the basic SCSS styling was given to us.

Happy Holidays!
